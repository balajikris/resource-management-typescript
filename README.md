# Manage Azure Resources and Resource Groups in Typescript

This sample explains how to manage your [resources and resource groups in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-overview/#resource-groups) using a Typescript client.


**Note**: This sample requires a future version of azure packages that is still work in progress.
See this [PR](https://github.com/Azure/autorest/pull/2084). Once this changed is merged and new versions of the packages are published to npm, just update the package versions in package.json to make this sample run.
